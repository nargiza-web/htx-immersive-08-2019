/*
Bonus: map
Implement your own custom map function which takes two arguments: an array arr and a function fun. It will return a new array, with each of its results being the result of calling fun with each array element.
*/

arr = [1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8];

function fun(x){
    return x * 2;
}

function myMap(arr, fun){
    let newArr = [];
    for (let item of arr){
        newArr.push(fun(item));
    }
    return newArr;
}

console.log(myMap(arr,fun));

// below is another way of defining function just pasted this from solutions
console.log(myMap(arr, function(x){
    return x * x ;
}));

//what is interesting is you may change your function along your way!! even if " named " function was defined previously differently
